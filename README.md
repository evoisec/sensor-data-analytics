##Data Indexing/Positioning inside Dataset, Dataset Synchronization and Dataset Join Algorithms 

The business objective of the project is Photoplethysmography (PPG) - optical method widely used nowadays for continuous heart rate monitoring.

Photoplethysmography is still a technically challenging area and hence to enable further research and data analysis, the Photoplethysmography signal data is complemented with body accelerometer, temperature, respiration, etc signal datasets 

The presence of several different sensor signal, time series datasets requires a method/algorithm for their synchronization/join   

Cross Dataset Indexing - Indexing/Synchronization/Join Across Datasets

Therefore the Heart Rate (as the key subject of research/"business analytics" here) is going to be used as the Ground Truth or will provide the Main Index 

Internal Dataset Indexing - Indexing within Single Dataset

Then, there is a need for Data Indexing method/algorithm within each sensor signal timeseries dataset
